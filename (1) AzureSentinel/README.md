## Notes for work done within Azure Sentinel

### AzureTrainingLab

A training guide I found online. Good supplement to the real world work I've done with the platform. 

The modules are a great refresher for Microsoft Sentinel and provide hands-on practical experience for product features, capabilities, and scenarios. The lab deploys a Microsoft Sentinel workspace and ingests pre-recorded data to simulate scenarios that showcase various Microsoft Sentinel features.

- Module 1 - Setting up the environment
- Module 2 - Data Connectors
- Module 3 - Analytics Rules
- Module 4 - Incident Management
- Module 5 - Hunting
- Module 6 - Watchlists
- Module 7 - Threat Intelligence
- Module 8 - Microsoft Sentinel Content hub

Detailed instructions followed in my own instance are in the 'AzureTrainingLab' folder.
